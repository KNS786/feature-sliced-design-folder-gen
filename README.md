# Feature Sliced Design CLI

Feature Sliced Design CLI is a command-line interface tool for generating slices following the Feature Sliced Design methodology. It helps automate the creation of pages, entities, and widgets in your project structure, promoting a modular and scalable architecture.

2.Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
 cd <your project directory>
```

Replace <your project directory> with the path to your project directory. This will ensure that the Feature Sliced Design CLI is installed globally and that you navigate to your project directory to use the CLI commands effectively.

When you navigate to your working directory and type `fsd-folder-cli`, you'll encounter two options:

  1. **Full**: This option allows you to create a folder with the same name and apply all available slices to it.
  2. **Individual**: This option enables you to create a folder under a specific slice folder, allowing you to apply only one slice. For example, you can create a folder under the "entities" slice folder.
These options provide flexibility in generating slices based on your project's needs, whether you want to apply multiple slices to a single folder or focus on applying a specific slice.
